# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Purchase Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will purchase a bike using classification models like **Logistic Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. The dataset contains customer information such as demographics and purchasing behavior.

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts bike purchases based on customer data, aiding businesses in better targeting and marketing strategies.

## 🔍 Project Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of target and feature variables
- Visualized relationships and trends using:
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Pairplots
  - Heatmaps for correlation

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values (if any)
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler/MinMaxScaler

### 3. Modeling
- Implemented **Logistic Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
